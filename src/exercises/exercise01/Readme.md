## React Styleguidist introduction

### Getting started

Run `npm start` and navigate to _Exercise 1_ in the sidebar. Use files in the `src/exercises/exercise01` folder.

[React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) is a tool that we use as a workbench to develop components, and to generate a style guide.

### The task

1. Explore React Styleguidist UI, try to switch to isolated mode (a button in the top right corner), try to edit the example code.

2. Edit examples in `Button.md`, add a new example.

3. Edit a component source in `Button.js`. See how all examples update every time you save a file.

4. Edit component’s `PropTypes` definition. Open “Props & methods” to see that the documentation updates.

5. Add a new component and an example file and see how it's added to the style guide.
